# BOTH "clickmobs.pickup" and "clickmobs.pickup.creeper" permissions.

# In the following section you can whitelist/blacklist mobs.
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# To whitelist/blacklist a vanilla mob, add its entity name.
#     i.E: "creeper" or "ender_dragon"
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# You can also use tags (predicates) to whitelist/blacklist mobs with certain properties.
# Available tags are:
#     ?all, ?hostile, ?baby, ?tamed, ?nametagged, ?silent, ?mob
# 
# You can (optionally) pass arguments to certain tags:
#     - ?nametagged(Dinnerbone)
# You can combine multiple tags:
#     - ?tamed ?nametagged
# You can negate tags using "not":
#     - not ?hostile
# You can use the ?mob tag alongside other tags to use tags on specific mobs:
#     - ?mob(creeper, zombie) ?nametagged(Friendly!)
# You can use the ?customdata tag to target mobs added by other plugins or mobs with
# custom data. Please read the wiki for more information on this tag.
# 
# Check the wiki for more documentation on tags:

  skeleton: 0
